### Description

This is an alteration to a control I found on freevbcode.com. You can set cells to checkboxes, comboboxes, textboxes or a button.

I previously submitted a version here. I have now added the ability to set the check mark on load by setting the cell value to "C".

I do not know how to save the colors on the control. I will leave that to someone else.

This could very easily be adapted to fill the grid from a database.

(I resubmitted this as new since I dont think it overwrote the original)
